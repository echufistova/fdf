# fdf
This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french, hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via segments.

Each number corresponds to a point in space:
- The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.
- The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.
- The value corresponds to its altitude.

To check the work of the project you need to compile it.
In the root of repository write "make" in your terminal, press Enter and then exe named "fdf" will be created. To start write: "./fdf test_map/test_map.fdf" in the terminal, where test_map.fdf is a certain map from test_map directory.
